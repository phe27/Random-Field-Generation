# Random-Field-Generation
This matlab codes are used to generate 2-dimensional random fields using Local Average Subdivision (LAS) method.

There is an example: `example.dat` contains all the input parameters. `getinp.m` reads the the specific example input file, so it can be adapted for your own input file. `wrtinp.m` write results into `example.out` which contains all the simulation result statistics.

`rfgen.m` is the MAIN file.
